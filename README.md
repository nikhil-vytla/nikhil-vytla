I'm a software engineer passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to empower communities, and building for education. I enjoy working with Python (TensorFlow, Keras), JavaScript (ReactJS, Node, TypeScript) and Java/Lua/SQL, with a recent direction on building consumer web/mobile apps and data pipeline APIs from the ground up. I was recently selected as an inaugural <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/dsc">Google DSC Lead 💡</a> and a <a href="https://live.forbes.com/under30/">Forbes 30 Under 30 Scholar 🌟</a>! I currently double major in Computer Science and Statistics at UNC 🐏 ('21) while conducting ML-focused biomedical research 🧪 on Alzheimer's disease modeling and building tech solutions for local non-profits and student orgs through <a href="https://cssgunc.org/">CS+Social Good</a> 🦄.
